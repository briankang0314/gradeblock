# gradeblock

 Overview
- Project Name: GradeBlock
- Description: A decentralized system for managing academic records on the Tezos blockchain, featuring multisig functionality for secure updates and transfers.

 Contract Components
1. AcademicRecord Contract (`academic_record.py`):
   - Purpose: Manages individual academic records.
   - Key Functionalities:
     - Create and store academic records.
     - Update records with multisig approvals.
     - Retrieve and verify records.
     - Transfer ownership of records.

2. Multisig Contract (`multisig.py`):
   - Purpose: Implements a multisig system for approving record updates.
   - Key Functionalities:
     - Create proposals for record updates.
     - Allow signatories to vote on proposals.
     - Execute changes upon reaching the required threshold of approvals.
     - Manage signatories and change approval thresholds.

3. AcademicRecordWithMultisig Contract (`academic_record_multisig.py`):
   - Purpose: Integrates academic record management with multisig functionality.
   - Key Functionalities:
     - Propose and execute record updates via multisig approval.
     - Inherit functionalities from the AcademicRecord and Multisig contracts.

 Usage Instructions
- Setting Up Contracts:
  - Deploy each contract separately on the Tezos blockchain.
  - Initialize the AcademicRecordWithMultisig contract with references to the AcademicRecord and Multisig contracts.
- Managing Records:
  - Creation, update, retrieval, and verification of academic records.
  - How to propose and approve changes using the multisig system.

 Development Notes
- Smart Contract Language: SmartPy (Python-like syntax for Tezos smart contracts).
- Blockchain: Tezos

 
Security Considerations
- Security Measures:
  - Multisig Approval: Changes to academic records require approvals from multiple authorized parties, mitigating unauthorized modifications.
  - Record Integrity Verification: Academic records include a hash to verify their integrity, preventing unnoticed tampering.
  - Access Control: Functions are protected to ensure only authorized users (like the record owner) can propose updates or transfer ownership.
- Potential Vulnerabilities and Mitigations:
  - Reentrancy Attacks: Not applicable as the contract does not involve TEZ transfers to external contracts.
  - Front-Running: Sensitive operations like ownership transfer are protected by multisig, reducing the risk.
  - Input Validation: All inputs are validated to prevent invalid or malicious data from being processed.

 Deployment Guide
- Deploying the Contracts:
  1. Preparation: Ensure you have a Tezos wallet with enough XTZ for deployment.
  2. Compilation: Use SmartPy CLI to compile the contracts to Michelson.
  3. Deployment:
     - Deploy `Multisig` first. Set initial signatories and threshold.
     - Deploy `AcademicRecord` with basic parameters.
     - Deploy `AcademicRecordWithMultisig`, referencing the addresses of the above two contracts.
  4. Verification: Verify the contracts on a Tezos explorer.
- Initial Parameters:
  - Set initial signatories in the `Multisig` contract carefully.
  - Choose a reasonable threshold for multisig approvals based on the number of signatories.

 Maintenance and Updates
- Monitoring Performance:
  - Regularly check contract operations through a Tezos blockchain explorer.
  - Monitor gas usage and execution times.
- Updating Contracts:
  - Smart contracts on Tezos are generally immutable. However, consider implementing a versioning system or an upgradeable pattern if necessary.
  - Communicate any updates or maintenance schedules to users.
